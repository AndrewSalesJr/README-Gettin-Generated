  ## [Description](#table-of-contents)

  README-Gettin-Generated is a command line application that allows users to answer a series of questions in their terminal which will create a new README.md file with a professional format.

  The README.md file is a very important aspect of every project that allows one to see everything about a project before opening any of the repository code. Sadly, this aspect is often overlooked either because one just never got around to it or they simply do not know how to properly format their README.md file.

  This application will help users to create an attractive README.md for their repository by requiring them only to input their project's specific information. The format of the README.md is already set up and ready to be rendered in the JavaScript.
